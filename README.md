### Hi, I'm Kangourou! 🦘

> *Back-end Developer building meaningful things.*

I am a software engineer focused on designing robust server-side architectures. I specialize in building scalable APIs, managing complex data flows, and optimizing backend performance.

**- What I'm currently working on**
I am actively developing backend solutions using **Go**, **NestJS**, and **Java**. 

**- The Tools & Stack I use**
I choose the right tool for the job, focusing on reliability and speed:
* **Languages:** Go (Golang), TypeScript (NestJS), Java.
* **Data & Caching:** PostgreSQL, Redis.
* **Infrastructure:** RabbitMQ (Messaging), Docker (Containerization).

**- Who am I?**
I'm a developer who enjoys the logic behind the scenes. Whether it's setting up a message broker or optimizing a database query, I love solving the "hard" problems that users never see but always feel in the application's performance.

**- How to reach me**
I'm always open to discussing backend architecture or new opportunities. You can find my **LinkedIn** profile linked directly in my bio ↖️.
